  - body: "Fencing is a sport that people of all ages can enjoy and offers a multitude of advantages. Fencing is a mental and physical exercise in which fencers learn to tackle opponents of different levels of skills and increase their physical resilience, agility and accuracy. Skills gained through fencing  extend to all areas of life. As a young person or adult, you can start fencing – for recreation, exercise and competitive practice.\n\nFencing’s three weapons are foil, sabre, and epee. The object of fencing is to score a point or touch by hitting the target of your opponent with your weapon before they get the touch of scoring on you, but with each weapon the rules, strategies and target areas differ to make the games distinct. As such, most fencers develop a preference and skill for one weapon over the other, but many enjoy the challenge and diversion of once in a while taking on a fight in another weapon, or even developing skills in a second weapon."
