      Fencing is a group of three sports related to fighting. Modern fencing’s
      three styles are foil, epée, and sabre (also sabre); winning points are
      made by contact with an adversary by the weapon. A fourth discipline,
      singlestick, appeared in the Olympics of 1904 but was dropped afterwards
      and is not part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the Olympics ‘ first
      sports to play. Modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century on the
      basis of the traditional skills of swordsmanship, with the Italian school
      modifying the historic European martial art of classical fencing, and the
      French school refining the Italian system later.


      Fencing is the swordplay recreational sport that people of all ages can
      enjoy and offers a multitude of advantages. Fencing is a mental and
      physical exercise in which fencing workers learn to tackle opponents of
      different levels of skills and increase their physical resilience, agility
      and accuracy. Trust and sport are gained through fencing participation and
      extended across other lifestyles. As a young person or adult, you can
      start fencing –for recreation, exercise and competitive practice.


      Fencing’s three weapons are shield, sabre, and epee. The object of fencing
      is to score a point or touch by hitting the target of your opponent with
      your weapon before they get the touch of scoring on you, but with each
      weapon the rules, strategies and target areas differ to make the games
      distinct. As such, most fencers develop a preference and skill for one
      weapon over the other, but many enjoy the challenge and diversion of once
      in a while taking on a fight in another weapon, or even developing skills
      in a second weapon. A rare fencer in all three weapons is an expert!
