# Art of Fencing At Resolute Sport Fencing

The sport of Fencing not only teaches you how to hold a sword properly, but it teaches you accuracy, agility, and physical pliability. At Resolute Sport Fencing, we show you how fencing can increase your mental and physical lifestyle to give you a more confident step to your walk. How does fencing give you more confidence? Well for starters, there are three types of weapons used when practicing the art of fencing. They are called the [Sabre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(fencing)), the [Epee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89p%C3%A9e) and the [Foil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)).
