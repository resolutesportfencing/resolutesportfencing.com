Professional fencing lessons for young people have many advantages. They improve concentration, agility, reflexes, balance, critical thinking and athletic skills. Fencing achievement is not dependent purely on stature, power, and speed; victory always goes to the best and most committed fencer.

Class styles and services differ by school. Many colleges and clubs are only training one weapon while some are providing all three. You’ll have to do some homework to figure out what’s best for your child.

Some clubs have services where children can attend an intro-fencing session. In intro classes, plastic equipment is used as early as four years of age for protection. At this age, the focus is on practical footwork, blade work, and drills for hand-eye coordination. Children enjoy our classes and get training on fencing.

# Beginner Professional Fencing Lessons

We switch to a beginner’s class at age 7 or 8 and begin using metal equipment. Typically, smaller children don’t have the fine motor skills to execute complex movements with a foil, or the attention required to obey weapons safety rules. Beginners’ classes will teach your child the fundamentals of how to fence. Beginners’ lessons will show you the fundamentals of how to fence.

# Intermediate Professional Fencing Lessons

The Intermediate training is designed for young fencers (school age). They have completed or fenced the Beginner Program previously and wish to improve their skills. Fencing classes at intermediate levels are practiced either in foil or [epee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55yZcibCHww) to have more specialized level instruction. Intermediate fencers learn the following Professional Fencing Lessons:

- Work on improving hand – and footwork
- Better distance control
- Increased fencing with electric fencing equipment
- Improving technical skills
- A better understanding of fencing rules
- Increased work in pairs during fencing exercises
- Better offensive and defensive skills
- Initial understanding of fencing tactics
- Improved conditioning level

Throughout the intermediate level, they can learn about the rules, tactics, and vocabulary of fencing competition between the ages of 11-16. Using the blade, more experienced students are exposed to attack and defense at the higher intermediate level, and they begin to bout.

Students can then go on to advanced or competitive classes based on skills and ability, where they will be exposed to the [epee and sabre](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/08/13/what-the-heck-is-a-saber-foil-and-epee-olympic-fencing-explained/). It is here where they start to take part in local and national competitions. The elite students compete on the national/international level. The graduates of the elite participate at the national/international level.

# Elite Fencing Lessons

The Advanced Level Class or Elite Group is intended for fences that have completed our club’s Intermediate Level Fencing Course or a related program level in another fencing School. A fencer at this level usually has a strong skill set, confidence and took part in at least one regional competition before reaching this level.

# How long does it take to learn fencing?

Keeping the physical fitness apart, as long as the real fencing training begins, it only takes about 4-5 months for a beginner to be able to participate in low-level local tournaments if one regularly practices for about 3-4 times a week and one or two days just to observe and evaluate bouts.
