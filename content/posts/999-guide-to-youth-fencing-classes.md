# The Benefits of Fencing for Kids

Your child will get a high-impact aerobic workout from [fencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezoZfZK75zA). They will build stamina, strength and coordination. Think of it as a type of dance, as it is very similar. Like dance, they will understand the concepts of timing, tempo, measure and velocity. Also, like dancing, the pupil must develop a sense of awareness of their body – the footwork and positioning in relation to their opponent. Since fencing is a sport, your child will learn the fundamentals of adopting healthy attitudes and healthy eating habits.

## Here are some benefits that your child will receive through fencing:

- Emphasis on sportsmanship
- Strengthens hand-eye coordination, confidence, self-discipline, and the ability to think on one's feet
- Great all around physical activity and aerobic workout
- Teaches young athletes to be quick on their feet – both mind and body
- Helps them develop thinking and problem-solving skills in a high-pressure situation
- Acts a stress reliever where children can release aggression in a controlled environment

# At What Age Can My Child Start Fencing?

There is no “official” age that children should start fencing. However, most fencers do start around the age of 9. Bear in mind that many fencing clubs do not accept children under the age of 7. This is because the hand-eye coordination needed in fencing is still not developed. If you're aiming your child toward competitive fencing, they are going to have to start early. Older children like 12-13 can get into competitive fencing, but it will take a larger commitment to catch up.

# What Equipment Do I Need to buy first?

There is a lot of [fencing gear and equipment](https://www.absolutefencinggear.com/) they’ll need. First and foremost, every fencer needs their own glove. The glove protects the hand and forearm. The second most important item to have is the mask. Fencing masks are to protect the face, sides and top of the head. For hygienic purposes, it’s advised that your child have their own glove and mask.

# Which Weapon Should My Child Start With? Foil, Epee Or Sabre?

A child can learn through the foil, epee or saber methods of fencing. An instructor can determine what kind of fencing weapon they need and what skill level they are at. Every weapon encompasses a range of fencing styles. Fencing is an individual sport where mental attributes play a large role in success. There is no need to worry if your child is tall, short, fast, slow, strong etc. Don’t try to pick out a weapon based on these factors. Traditionally, the foil is the best starting point for a fencer, as the foil offers the features of the epee and saber.
