## Who gives out athletic scholarships?

Athletic scholarships are typically one-year agreements between the college and the athlete, although some are multi-year. They are offered at the NCAA DI and DII levels as well as at the NAIA and NJCAA levels combined. That’s thousands of schools. DIII colleges do not offer athletic scholarships. But many DIII student-athletes receive financial aid full-ride scholarships for all 4 years? How much scholarship money can you get?

Fewer than 2 percent of high school student-athletes are offered athletic scholarships. These scholarships add up to over $3.1 billion annually for DI and DII alone, so there’s certainly money out there. However, it’s important to understand that most athletic scholarships are not full rides. The amount you’re offered has a lot to do with your sport and whether it is a headcount or equivalency sport.

- **Headcount sports** are always full rides. But they only include revenue sports: for men, that’s DI basketball and DI-A football; for women, it’s DI basketball, tennis, volleyball and gymnastics.​
- **Equivalency sports** usually hand out partial scholarships. It’s up to the coach to divide their scholarship money among athletes. That could mean they offer a full ride to one extremely high-level recruit (although that is rare), or it could mean they spread the money out among multiple athletes, which is much more common.

## Equivalency Sports

Equivalency sports for DI men include baseball, rifle, skiing, cross-country, track, and field, soccer, fencing, swimming, tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, ice hockey, lacrosse, and wrestling. For DI women, Equivalency sports include bowling, lacrosse, rowing, cross-country, track and field, skiing, fencing, soccer, field hockey, softball, golf, swimming, ice hockey, and water polo. All DII and NAIA sports are equivalency sports. This article details some ways coaches decide on scholarship amounts.

## How do you get a full-ride athletic scholarship?

Most student-athletes do not receive a full-ride scholarship—in fact, only 1 percent do. Still, full-ride scholarships are the goal for many athletes because they typically cover tuition, fees, books, room, board, supplies, and sometimes even living expenses. If you receive a scholarship for a DI headcount sport, you’re guaranteed a full ride. But there are only six headcount sports.

If you play an equivalency sport, you can increase your chances of getting more scholarship money. For example, if you fill a specific and important role on the team—such as a baseball or softball pitcher—you’re more likely to receive a larger offer. You can also use the leverage of multiple recruiting offers to get coaches to increase the amount they are willing to give you. Sometimes, just moving down a division level will get you more money. A lower-level recruit for DI might receive a larger scholarship at the DII level.

## College Fencing Scholarships

Although it may not be a popular sport as football or other college sports, [fencing](http://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/sports/fencing.htm) has been in collegiate athletic programs for hundreds of years.
